# Automation Testing

# Project In Selenium

My First Project In Selenium:

# The Assignment:
Our teacher divided us into groups, my group included me and 2 other people.

We got a website and our task was to do automation tests for the website
each tester was given a different section on the web page
I received the following pages:

and also according to the division into Sanity,Regression and API

# Tools:
