# Automation Testing
This is my first project in Selenium!
Our teacher divided us into groups, my group included me and 2 QA testers.

We got a website and our task was to do automation tests for the website
each tester was given a different section on the web page
I received the following pages:
Login page, User profile page, About-us page
# Tests:
My tests were divided according to the pages I had to test 
and also according to the division into Sanity,Regression and API
# Tools:
In this project I used Pytest, Selenium, Locust, Appium, Requests, Allure
The Bonus was to execute The tests from Jenkins.
I add Sanity and Regression builds, when there is change in the project this builds run automatically.
